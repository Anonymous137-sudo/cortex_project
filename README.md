# CryptEX

Current release: `v0.6.3`

Public contact: `Anon-Sec-BTCC@proton.me`

CryptEX is a C++ SHA3-512 cryptocurrency with full 512-bit proof-of-work math, a separate Qt GUI and backend daemon, encrypted HD wallets, secure chat, JSON-RPC, adaptive difficulty control, and multi-network support across mainnet, testnet, and regtest.

## Current Highlights

- SHA3-512 proof of work with full 512-bit consensus math and chainwork
- Hybrid adaptive difficulty control with LWMA, EMA, real-time overdue easing, and emergency recovery
- Mainnet, testnet, and regtest network profiles
- Separate GUI app and backend CLI/node binary
- Base64, Base58, `0x` hex, and Bech32 address encodings
- Encrypted `Wallet.dat` storage with BIP32/BIP39 HD wallet support and recovery tooling
- Multi-threaded solo mining with sync-before-mining behavior and `--block-cycles`
- Unified mining flow so the GUI miner and CLI/backend mine against the same live backend chain state instead of separate local chain copies
- P2P networking with peer exchange, DNS seeds, LAN/WLAN auto-discovery, headers-first sync, and cumulative-work chain selection
- JSON-RPC for node, wallet, mining, chat, and operator functions
- Address-first P2P messenger with public forum, private history, voice relay, and media composers
- Secure public/private chat support with forum-style views and direct directory actions
- Advanced Mode gating for Node Window and P2P Messenger
- FastAPI website and Wrapped CryptEX EVM workspace
- System datadir defaults so chain and wallet data survive binary deletion

## Release Matrix

The current release pipeline produces these platform artifacts:

- macOS ARM64: daemon, tests, Qt app bundle, dedicated ARM64 assembly PoW worker
- Linux x86_64: daemon, tests, AppImage, external PoW worker binary
- Linux ARM64: daemon, tests, AppImage, dedicated ARM64 assembly PoW worker
- Windows x86_64: daemon, tests, runtime bundle zip, external PoW worker binary

For this school-facing repository, staged GitHub releases are intentionally narrowed to the Windows runtime bundle so the downloadable artifact matches the Windows lab environment.

Worker backend notes:

- ARM64 macOS and Linux builds use handwritten assembly workers under `src/asm/`
- Linux x86_64 and Windows x86_64 use dedicated handwritten external assembly workers under `src/asm/`, with AVX2-focused four-lane nonce search on AVX2-capable CPUs
- Consensus stays in the daemon on every platform; workers only search nonce ranges

## Build

Native macOS ARM64 backend example:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build-release/macOS-ARM64 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build-release/macOS-ARM64 --target cryptexd cryptex_tests -j4
```

Full release matrix:

```bash
./scripts/build-release-matrix.sh all
```

Windows x86_64 dependency bootstrap:

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap-windows-x86_64-deps.sh
export OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR_WIN_X86_64="$PWD/third_party/windows-x86_64/openssl"
export OPUS_ROOT_DIR_WIN_X86_64="$PWD/third_party/windows-x86_64/opus"
export QT6_ROOT_WIN_X86_64="$HOME/Qt/6.10.2/mingw_64"
./scripts/build-release-matrix.sh windows-x86_64
```

## Run

Start the backend node:

```bash
./build-release/macOS-ARM64/cryptexd_osx node
```

Start mining forever against the local backend RPC:

```bash
./build-release/macOS-ARM64/cryptexd_osx mine --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:9332/ --rpcuser <user> --rpcpassword <pass> --address <your_address> --cycles 0
```

Mine multiple blocks in sequence:

```bash
./build-release/macOS-ARM64/cryptexd_osx mine --address <your_address> --cycles 0 --block-cycles 4
```

Start the GUI:

```bash
open ./build-release/macOS-ARM64/cryptexqt_osx.app
```

## Website

The project website is now a real FastAPI application rather than a static HTML page.

Run it locally:

```bash
cd ./website
./run.sh
```

By default the website runner now binds to `0.0.0.0:8080`, so other machines on the same network can reach it through:

```bash
http://<your-machine-ip>:8080
```

## Data Locations

By default, CryptEX stores chain and wallet data in system application-data locations:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/CryptEX`
- Linux: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/CryptEX` or `~/.local/share/CryptEX`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\\CryptEX`
